I converted a 1992 ambulance with 35,000 km into a camper van. Before starting, I created a full 3D model of the interior. The build includes full insulation and custom woodwork, all done by myself using partly recycled materials. The bed extends from 80 cm to 140 cm, and the rear storage holds my snowboard and surf gear. I installed an electrical system with 200W output and shore power connection. The water system will be added in the future.
