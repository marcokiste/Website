The project focuses on the development of an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) based on compliant mechanisms. The orthosis supports dorsiflexion and offers a large range of motion to enhance mobility. The mechanical design was parameterized and verified using FEM. Further optimizations were carried out for additive manufacturing, including path and overhang minimization, as well as material optimization. Finally, a functional prototype was produced using 3D printing.
