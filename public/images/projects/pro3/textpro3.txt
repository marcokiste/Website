During my lab work at the University of Tokyo, I contributed to two projects. The first focused on developing a super-hydrophobic nanocoating, creating surfaces that strongly repel water through nanoscale structuring. The second involved designing a heat pump that uses a natural gas refrigerant—such as propane or CO₂—as a sustainable alternative to traditional F-gases, in response to the upcoming EU-wide ban on high-GWP refrigerants.
