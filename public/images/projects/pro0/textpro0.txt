Shaping a surfboard starts with cutting the blank, then refining the rocker, rails, and concaves—these elements are crucial for how the board performs in the water. After smoothing the surface, the board is laminated with fiberglass and resin to make it strong and waterproof. Once glassed, there is a long, multi-step sanding process to achieve a perfect finish. It’s a demanding craft that requires experience and precision. I also embedded a flower under the laminate.
